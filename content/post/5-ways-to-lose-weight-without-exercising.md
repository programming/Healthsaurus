There are many reasons why people seek to lose weight. Some for health reasons while others to simply look or feel good about themselves. Regardless of the reason, embarking on a weight loss journey never seems easy.

Bad habits die hard and trying to get yourself to suddenly commit to a strict diet or extreme exercise schedule normally does not work out.

Thankfully for us, there are other ways to lose weight with just a few simple tweaks in our daily habits. Here are 5 of them to get you started!

1. **Drinking water**

	We are often reminded on the importance of staying hydrated, but can drinking water actually help us lose weight?
	
	The answer is YES. Not only does this zero calories drink help increase metabolism, it burns calories too! Studies have shown that drinking cold water helps burn more calories as the body uses more energy to heat up the water for digestion.
	
	People have also tend to confuse thirst for hunger. If you find yourself reaching out for snacks every now and then, there is a high chance that your body is actually dehydrated. So before you subconsciously add more calories to your daily intake, why not remind yourself to drink more water instead.
	
	Many have claimed that water also acts as an appetite suppressant and drinking a glass of water 30 minutes before your meal can help reduce your appetite. Moreover, the water would cause you to feel fuller, essentially controlling your appetite and calories intake. 

2. **Having sufficient sleep**

	Did you know that our body burns calories even while we are sleeping? Research has shown that a person with sufficient amounts of sleep burns more calories than one without.
	
	That being said, over sleeping can slow down one’s metabolism rate which is counter productive for your weight loss plans. The recommended hours lies between having 7 to 9 hours of quality sleep. The number of calories burned while sleeping however, varies per individual. Factors such as age, gender, weight, and metabolism rate has to be taken into consideration as well.
	
	Sleep deprivation also affects certain hormones in your body, causing you to feel hungrier and have increased cravings for junk food. The brain tends to make less tactful choices due to the lack of rest and often, to counter the lack of energy, you find yourself reaching for junk food. 

3. **Reduce sugar intake**

	Soft drinks in general are extremely high in calories. Not only does it have no nutrients, it is detrimental to our body and dental health as well.
	
	According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the recommended sugar intake of an adult is 25 grams (or 6 teaspoons) per day.
	
	A 330 ml can of coke contains 35 grams of sugar (7 teaspoons). One teaspoon of sugar contains approximately 16 cal which translates to 112 calories in a single can of coke! This excludes our other sugar consumptions throughout the day.
	
	Sugar is also found within our daily foods. Foods such as pasta, bread, sauces, and more are often packed with hidden sugar. Packaged food tend to have a much higher sugar content that you think. This includes your “healthy” products like fruit juices and yogurts.
	
	To prevent yourself from unknowingly consuming more calories than you had hoped to, make sure to check those ingredients list before consumption. Also, try ditching sweetened drinks or soda for plain water and notice the difference for yourself!
	
4. **Eating right**

	Have you ever skipped a meal or two in a bid to lose some weight? Many people tend to think that the key to weight loss is to cut down on their food intake. That may be true, but not entirely.
	
	It is important to eat even when you are trying to lose weight. Not only does skipping meals not help you lose weight, it increases your cravings for junk food throughout the day causing you to snack more!
	
	Instead, try reducing your meal portions and increasing your meal frequencies. Although not scientifically proven that small, frequent meals can help increase your fat burn, it does make your dieting process a lot easier.
	
	When your body stays hungry for a prolonged period of time, you tend to overeat in your next meal.  Hence, by nibbling on a healthy snack or two between your main meals, you wlll be able to better control your appetite and not over indulge to make up for the lack of.
	
5. **Eat slower**

	Good news for slow eaters! Slower eating can actually aid in your weight loss. Eating too quickly tend to lead to overeating as the brain has not had the time to receive signals that the body is full.
	
	It takes your brain approximately 20 minutes to register that you stomach is full, whereas most of us finish our meals way before that. By reducing your pace, the body is able to comprehend when to stop eating allowing for better control of your intake.
	
	Chewing our food into smaller pieces can also allow our body to absorb the nutrients  more easily allowing for better digestion. On the contrary, eating too quickly not only burn lesser calories, it is bad for our digestion.
	
	So why not reduce your pace, immerse yourself in the flavour of your food, and enjoy your meal to the fullest.
