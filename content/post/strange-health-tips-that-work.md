![10 Strange Health Tips That Work](/img/horizon.jpeg)

Here are some interesting and seemingly peculiar health-related tips that are actually backed by science.

1. Handwriting things improves your memory

	In this day and age, one will be hard-pressed to find a student or office worker actually handwriting their notes. However, a paper from Indiana University found that in order to remember something, you should write it down instead of typing it.

	Writing by hand requires different cognitive processes than typing so a student taking lecture notes will be able to digest and learn more effectively than another who is simply typing words into the laptop.

2. Avoid liquid hand soap

	They have become ubiquitous in our home and pretty much everywhere else, but researchers have warned that the expensive, anti-bacterial liquid soap are no better than ordinary soap.
	
	The study published in the Clinical Infectious Diseseas journal found that triclosan, the primary active ingredient in most of the market's anti-bacterial soaps, can cause some bacteria to gain resistance to commonly used antibiotics such as amoxicillin. Bacteria are high adaptable and once that happens, it will be more challenging to fight against them. Examples include E.coli and salmonella, major contributors in food poisoning.	

3. Drink something hot to cool down

	While it might not sound logical, according to a study from the University of Ottawa's School of Human Kinetics, if you want your body to cool down, drink something hot. As the drink is hotter than your body temperature, it triggers perspiration which allows your body to effectively cool itself faster.

4. Prevent depression with coffee

	Amongst the eternal ongoing debate on whether coffee is actually good or bad for your health, coming from the Harvard School of Public Health, the researchers found that women who drank at least four cups of coffee a day could lower the risk of depression by twenty percent!
	
	So ladies, remind ourselves of the health benefits of coffee when you're on the fourth cup of your StarBucks. &#128518;

5. Heighten your alertness by chewing gum

	Feeling drowsy after lunch and unable to concentrate on work? Chew some gum to wake yourself up, specifically, mint flavoured gum. Researchers from Coventry University found that chewing mint flavoured gum significantly eliminates fatigue. From a separate study, it was found that chewing gum improves overall test scores, reduce anxiety levels and relive stress.

6. Smell an apple

	An apple a day keeps the doctor away. How about just sniffing it?
	
	Through a study conducted by The Smell and Taste Treatment and Research Foundation, smelling a green apple helped reduce the severity of migraines and relieve the stress associated with confined spaces, namingly, claustrophobia, which 5-7% of the world population is affected by.

7. Flush the toilet with the lid down

	According to Microbiologist Dr. Charles Gerba, from the University of Arizona, everyone should always flush with the toilet seat lid down. If you don't, water particle pollutants will disperse and float around the bathroom for a couple of hours before landing eventually, some on your toothbrush. Eek!

8. Sitting at your work desk increases the risk of death by 48%

	According to a research from the University of Sydney, they found that if you sit for longer than ten hours a day at your desk, in comparison to people for sits for less than four hours a day, there is an increase of 48% in the risk of death.
	
	Unfortunately, this is what the modern office worker have to endure. One way to circumvent this is just take regular breaks away from your workstation, few minutes of activity like going to get the washroom or double up as an opportunity to touch base with your colleagues.

9. Feeling tired? Exercise!

	After a long and hectic day at work, donning your sports attire and hitting the gym is probably the last thing you have in mind but research from the Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise journal found that exercising actually gives you more energy. Participants' fatigue and depression levels improved substantially after a thirty minute session of moderate intensity workout.

10. Optimists live longer than pessimists

	Heart patients who were more optimistic about their treatment have a longer lifespan than those who harboured a more pessimistic view. The journal from the European Heart Journal also revealed that optimistic people have a lower chance of suffering from heart disease.
