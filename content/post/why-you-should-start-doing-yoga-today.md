For many years now, yoga classes have been one of the most popular activity being offered at gyms around the country.

If you are already a regular yoga practitioner, there is no doubt you've already experienced some of the subtle health and wellness benefits in your daily life. Yoga is a complete mind-body experience, enriching the practitioner both physically and mentally.

Here are some of the reasons you should start doing yoga today:

1. Reduce Stress

	Research has shown that yoga is an amazing method of reducing stress. It may even reduce symptoms of more serious mental health issues like anxiety. Yoga is made up of three elements; poses, breathing, and meditation. People who regularly practice all three elements are able to better regulate their heart rate variability (HRV). This means that their heart rate is lower, which in turns gives the body the ability to respond to stress in a more flexible manner.

2. Breathe Better

	Deep and calm breathing is a core component of every yoga practice. Pranayama, which refers to a particular yogic breathing technique focuses on breathing completely from the pit of your stomach to the top of your lungs. This method encourages a more focused and balanced way of breathing which is not something one will do consciously every day without proper training.

	It will help you in staying calm during emergencies so you will be able to think clearer in stressful situations.

3. Sleep Better

	Practising daily yoga can reduce or even completely prevent insomnia. If you are experiencing insomnia, practise relaxing asanas or postures. Doing so calms your body and mind allowing you to drift into a slumber. Working on areas which are causing you problems through yoga helps to alleviate the pain symptoms and increases the chances of better quality of sleep.

4. Be Happier

	A recent study has shown that doing regular yoga and meditation led to higher serontonin levels (the happiness hormone). Long-term yoga practicioners have more brain mass in the areas commonly associated with contentment.

	Another research discovered that one brainâ€™s gamma-aminobutyric (GABA) levels are higher after yoga activity. Higher GABA levels are typically associated with lower levels of depression and anxiety. Essentially, just by doing a simple session of yoga daily can improve your brain chemistry and go towards boosting your mood.

5. Improve Your Fitness

	Doing yoga will help strech and tone the different parts of body muscles. The plank, one of the more popular poses, will singlehandedly aid in the strengthening of arms, legs, shoulders and abs. With aspects of cardio, functional and strength training combined, yoga is the ideal option to get stronger and healthier in a more holistic fashion.

	On weight loss, you do not have to specifically practise hot yoga just to achieve your dream figure. Even a daily, gentle yoga session will fuel the metabolic system and help burn fat. Through yoga, you will also restore the hormonal balance in your body, which can aid in normalising the body weight.

6. Improve Concentration

	Meditation itself and several yoga poses require the practitioner to concentrate on his or her breathing. This process calms your mind, aids in the reduction of mental stress and physical tension. The result is that you will have better concentration throughout the day and you will be able to recall things easier with a more organised thought flow.

	Yoga practitioners will develop one-pointedness concentration with regular, daily sessions and the mind become more aware and present.
